The healthcare industry is undergoing a paradigm shift from a one-size-fits-all
 approach to a more tailored and individualized model of care [8,7]. P5 medicine
 (predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory and psycho-cognitive medicine)
 [19] is at the forefront of this transformation, aiming to provide treatments that
 are specifically designed for individual patients based on their unique genetic, en
vironmental, and lifestyle factors [36]. Traditional medical practices often rely on
 generalized treatment protocols that do not account for the significant variability
 among patients. This approach can lead to suboptimal outcomes, as treatments
 that are effective for one group of patients may be ineffective or even harmful
 for others [34]. This lack of personalization in treatment plans can result in pro
longed illness, increased healthcare costs, and a higher incidence of adverse drug
 reactions. This is, in large part, because genetic variability plays a crucial role
 in how individuals respond to medications and treatments [24]. For example,
 certain genetic mutations can affect drug metabolism, leading to variations in
 drug efficacy and safety. P5 medicine can leverage genetic information to identify
 these variations and tailor treatments accordingly. By understanding a patientâ€™s
 genetic makeup, healthcare providers can predict which treatments will be most
 effective and avoid those that may cause harm. Because of the aging and growing
 populations, diseases and health care costs rise, making disease prevention even
 more important. Many complex diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
 and neurological disorders, have multifactorial causes that involve intricate inter
actions between genes, environment, and lifestyle. Traditional approaches often
 fall short in addressing these complexities. P5 medicine, through advanced tech
nologies such as genomic sequencing and bioinformatics, can unravel these in
teractions and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of diseases. This
 knowledge enables the development of targeted therapies that address the root
 causes of diseases rather than just alleviating symptoms. Personalized medicine
